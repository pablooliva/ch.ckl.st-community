The process for finding a new job can be stressful. I found it helpful to have a list of actions that I needed to take in order to reach my goal of finding a better job.</p><h2>Who this is For</h2><p>This guide is useful primarily for anyone with work experience in software development who is looking for a new job.</p><h2>What to Expect</h2><p>When most people are ready to find a new job, they start with updating their resume and then proceed to blast it out in response to any job posting online that seems like a potential good fit. Companies have a high demand for new recruits in our field so this is an acceptable pattern to follow if you are looking for just any new job.</p><p>On the other hand, if you want to find a job that is better than the one you have now, you need to prepare and be more strategic. This checklist guides you through some steps that will make you more effective in finding and securing a new job that is a better fit for you.</p><h3>On GitHub</h3><p>This checklist is also&nbsp;available on GitHub as a Markdown file&nbsp;so that you can:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://github.com/pablooliva/ch.ckl.st-community/blob/master/checklists/result-files/5c6adbdf0b3726004a02ee21_Steps_to_Finding_Better_Work_as_a_Mid-Level_to_Senior_Software_Developer.md\" target=\"_blank\">Submit corrections, additions, or improvements as a pull request</a></li><li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablooliva/ch.ckl.st-community/master/checklists/result-files/5c6adbdf0b3726004a02ee21_Steps_to_Finding_Better_Work_as_a_Mid-Level_to_Senior_Software_Developer.md\" target=\"_blank\">Copy and paste the raw Markdown into a gist to use on your own</a></li></ol>",
