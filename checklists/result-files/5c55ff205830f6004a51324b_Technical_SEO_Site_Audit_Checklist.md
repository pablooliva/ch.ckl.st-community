# Technical SEO Site Audit Checklist
  
<p><img src="https://api.ch.ckl.st/user-images/moz.png-1549140437661.png"></p><p>This is based on a checklist by <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkenyon" target="_blank">Geoff Kenyon</a> on <a href="https://moz.com/blog/technical-site-audit-for-2015" target="_blank">Moz</a>.</p><p>This checklist is part of a comprehensive series on critical&nbsp;<a href="https://ch.ckl.st/share/5c38a726792475004a001e19" target="_blank">checklists for web development</a>.</p><p><strong>WARNING</strong>: There are several references to Google Analytics in this checklist, without mention of any alternatives. Google Analytics is a major player in the analytics space, mainly because it is a "free" product, but there are privacy implications when you get in bed with a monopoly like Google. At ch.ckl.st, we are <a href="https://voice.ch.ckl.st/privacy-matters/" target="_blank">sensitive about protecting our users' privacy</a> and avoid the use of Google Analytics. Some alternatives include:</p><ol><li><a href="https://simpleanalytics.io/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(120, 60, 177);">Simple Analytics</a></li><li><a href="https://usefathom.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(120, 60, 177);">Fathom Analytics</a></li><li><a href="https://matomo.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(120, 60, 177);">Matomo</a></li></ol>


## Quick Initial Review


  
- [ ] Check indexed pages 
      <ul><li>Do a "site:" search, i.e. search for the term "site: [yoursite.com]"</li><li>How many pages are returned? (This can be way off so don't put too much stock in this).</li><li>Is the homepage showing up as the first result?</li><li>If the homepage isn't showing up as the first result, there could be issues, like a penalty or poor site architecture/internal linking, affecting the site. This may be less of a concern as Google's John Mueller <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-site-command-home-page-19664.html" target="_blank">recently</a> said that your homepage doesn't need to be listed first.</li></ul>

- [ ] Review the number of organic landing pages in Google Analytics
      <ul><li>Does this match with the number of results in a site: search?</li><li>This is often the best view of how many pages are in a search engine's index that search engines find valuable.</li></ul>

- [ ] Search for the brand and branded terms
      <ul><li>Is the homepage showing up at the top, or are correct pages showing up?</li><li>If the proper pages aren't showing up as the first result, there could be issues, like a penalty, in play.</li></ul>

- [ ] Check Google's cache for key pages
      <ul><li>Is the content showing up?</li><li>Are navigation links present?</li><li>Are there links that aren't visible on the site?</li></ul>

- [ ] Check text-only version of cached pages
      <p>Here is a <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">bookmarklet</a> to help you do that.</p><p>If you are not familiar with bookmarklets, <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarklets-perform-common-web-page-tasks" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> offers an excellent explanation.</p>

- [ ] Do a mobile search for your brand and key landing pages
      <ul><li>Does your listing have the "mobile friendly" label?</li><li>Are your landing pages mobile friendly?</li><li>If the answer is no to either of these, it may be costing you organic visits.</li></ul>

- [ ] Check for mobile friendliness
      <ul><li>Google uses <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank">mobile optimization</a> as a ranking factor.</li><li><a href="https://searchengineland.com/seo-2017-mobile-optimisation-competitive-advantage-265760" target="_blank">Mobile optimization as a competitive advantage</a>.</li></ul>



## On-page Optimization


  
- [ ] Title tags are optimized 
      <ul><li>Title tags should be optimized and unique.</li><li>Your brand name should be included in your title tag to improve click-through rates.</li><li>Title tags are about 55-60 characters (512 pixels) to be fully displayed. You can test <a href="https://moz.com/blog/new-title-tag-guidelines-preview-tool" target="_blank">here</a> or review title pixel widths in Screaming Frog.</li></ul>

- [ ] Important pages have click-through rate optimized titles and meta descriptions
      <ul><li>This will help improve your organic traffic independent of your rankings.</li><li>You can use <a href="http://www.tomanthony.co.uk/tools/serp-turkey/" target="_blank">SERP Turkey</a> for this.</li></ul>

- [ ] Check for pages missing page titles and meta descriptions
      

- [ ] On-page content includes the primary keywords
      <p>The on-page content includes the primary keyword phrase multiple times as well as variations and alternate keyword phrases.</p>

- [ ] Review content on key pages
      <p>There is a significant amount of optimized, unique content on key pages.</p>

- [ ] H1 tags contains keywords
      <p>The primary keyword phrase is contained in the H1 tag.</p>

- [ ] Image file names and alt text include keywords
      <p>Images' file names and alt text are optimized to include the primary keyword phrase associated with the page.</p>

- [ ] URLs are descriptive and optimized
      <p>While it is beneficial to include your keyword phrase in URLs, changing your URLs can negatively impact traffic when you do a 301. As such, I typically recommend optimizing URLs when the current ones are really bad or when you don't have to change URLs with existing external links.</p>

- [ ] Clean, short URLs
      <ul><li>No excessive parameters or session IDs.</li><li>URLs exposed to search engines should be static.</li><li>115 characters or shorter â€“ this character limit isn't set in stone, but shorter URLs are better for usability.</li></ul><p>Additional reading:</p><ul><li><a href="https://moz.com/blog/11-best-practices-for-urls" target="_blank">Best Practices for URLs</a></li><li><a href="http://www.webconfs.com/url-rewriting-tool.php" target="_blank">URL Rewriting Tool</a></li><li><a href="http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/mod_rewrite-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">mod_rewrite Cheat Sheet</a></li><li><a href="http://www.seobook.com/archives/001714.shtml" target="_blank">Creating 301 Redirects With .htaccess</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>

- [ ] Homepage content is optimized
      <ul><li>Does the homepage have at least one paragraph?</li><li>There has to be enough content on the page to give search engines an understanding of what a page is about. At least 150 words are recommended.</li></ul>

- [ ] Landing pages are optimized 
      <ul><li>Do these pages have at least a few paragraphs of content? Is it enough to give search engines an understanding of what the page is about?</li><li>Is it template text or is it completely unique?</li></ul>

- [ ] Site contains real and substantial content
      <p>Is there real content on the site or is the "content" simply a list of links?</p>

- [ ] Proper keyword targeting
      <ul><li>Does the intent behind the keyword match the intent of the landing page?</li><li>Are there pages targeting head terms, mid-tail, and long-tail keywords?</li></ul>

- [ ] Content to help users convert exists and is easily accessible to users
      <p>In addition to search engine driven content, there should be content to help educate users about the product or service.</p>

- [ ] Content formatting 
      <ul><li>Is the content formatted well and easy to read quickly?</li><li>Are H tags used?</li><li>Are images used?</li><li>Is the text broken down into easy to read paragraphs?</li></ul>

- [ ] Good headlines on blog posts
      <p>Good headlines go a long way. Make sure the headlines are well written and draw users in.</p>

- [ ] Amount of content versus ads
      <ul><li>Since the implementation of Panda, the amount of ad-space on a page has become important to evaluate.</li><li>Make sure there is significant unique content above the fold.</li><li>If you have more ads than unique content, you are probably going to have a problem.</li></ul>



## Duplicate Content

<p>Duplicate content carries a penalty with search engines. Avoid it. Here are some things to look out for.</p>
  
- [ ] There should be one URL for each piece of content 
      <ul><li>Do URLs include parameters or tracking code? This will result in multiple URLs for a piece of content.</li><li>Does the same content reside on completely different URLs? This is often due to products/content being replicated across different categories.</li></ul>

- [ ] Do a search to check for duplicate content
      <ul><li>Take a content snippet, put it in quotes and search for it.</li><li>Does the content show up elsewhere on the domain?</li><li>Has it been scraped? If the content has been scraped, you should file a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=ts.cs&amp;ts=1114905" target="_blank">content removal request</a> with Google.</li></ul>

- [ ] Sub-domain duplicate content
      <p>Does the same content exist on different sub-domains?</p>

- [ ] Check for a secure and non-secure versions of the site
      <p>Does the same content exist on secure and non-secure versions of the site? Search engines will treat this as duplicate content. In current times, there is hardly any reason why your site should be delivered over a non-https-connection.</p>

- [ ] Check for "print" pages 
      <p>If there are "printer friendly" versions of pages, they may be causing duplicate content.</p>



## Accessibility & Indexation


  
- [ ] Check the robots.txt
      <p>Has the entire site, or important content been blocked? Is <a href="http://www.lighthouseseo.org/links/link-equity/" target="_blank">link equity</a> being orphaned due to pages being blocked via the robots.txt?</p>

- [ ] Turn off JavaScript, cookies, and CSS
      <ul><li>Use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/web-developer/" target="_blank">Web Developer Toolbar</a></li><li>Is the content there?</li><li>Do the navigation links work?</li></ul>

- [ ] Now change your user agent to Googlebot
      <ul><li><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/113439/how-to-change-your-browsers-user-agent-without-installing-any-extensions/" target="_blank">How to</a> for both Chrome and Firefox</li><li>Does it look the same as before?</li></ul>

- [ ] XML sitemaps are listed in the robots.txt file
      

- [ ] XML sitemaps are submitted
      <ul><li>For <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en" target="_blank">Google</a></li><li>For <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/how-to-submit-sitemaps-82a15bd4" target="_blank">Bing</a></li></ul>

- [ ] Check pages for meta robots noindex tag
      <ul><li>Are pages accidentally being tagged with the meta robots noindex command</li><li>Are there pages that should have the noindex command applied</li><li>You can check the site quickly via a crawl tool such as Moz or Screaming Frog</li></ul>

- [ ] Do goal pages have the noindex command applied?
      <p>This is important to prevent direct organic visits from showing up as goals in analytics.</p>



## Site Architecture and Internal Linking

- [ ] Number of links on a page
      <p>100-200 is a good target, but <a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-many-links-is-too-many" target="_blank">not a rule</a>.</p>

- [ ] Vertical linking structures are in place
      <ul><li>Homepage links to category pages.</li><li>Category pages link to sub-category and product pages as appropriate.</li><li>Product pages link to relevant category pages.</li></ul>

- [ ] Horizontal linking structures are in place
      <ul><li>Category pages link to other relevant category pages.</li><li>Product pages link to other relevant product pages.</li></ul>

- [ ] Links are in content 
      <p>Does not utilize massive blocks of links stuck in the content to do internal linking.</p>

- [ ] Footer links
      <ul><li>Does not use a block of footer links instead of proper navigation.</li><li>Does not link to landing pages with optimized anchors.</li></ul>

- [ ] Good internal anchor text 
      

- [ ] Check for broken links
      <p>Link Checker and Xenu are good tools for this.</p>



## Technical Issues


  
- [ ] Proper use of 301s
      <ul><li>Are 301s being used for all redirects?</li><li>If the root is being directed to a landing page, are they using a 301 instead of a 302?</li><li>Use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-and-headers-analyser/" target="_blank">Header Analyzer</a> Firefox plugin to check 301s.</li></ul>

- [ ] "Bad" redirects are avoided 
      <ul><li>These include 302s (temporary redirects), 307s, meta refresh, and JavaScript redirects <a href="http://geoffkenyon.com/302-redirects-pass-link-equity-pagerank/" target="_blank">as they pass little to no value.</a></li><li>These redirects can easily be identified with a tool like Screaming Frog.</li></ul>

- [ ] Redirects point directly to the final URL and do not leverage redirect chains
      <ul><li>Redirect chains significantly diminish the amount of link equity associated with the final URL.</li><li>Google has said that they will stop following a redirect chain after several redirects.</li></ul>

- [ ] Check for errors in Google Webmaster Tools 
      <p>Google WMT will give you a good list of technical problems that they are encountering on your site (such as: 4xx and 5xx errors, inaccessible pages in the XML sitemap, and soft 404s).</p>

- [ ] XML Sitemaps
      <ul><li>Are XML sitemaps in place?</li><li>Are XML sitemaps covering for poor site architecture?</li><li>Are XML sitemaps <a href="http://www.distilled.net/blog/seo/indexation-problems-diagnosis-using-google-webmaster-tools/" target="_blank">structured</a> to show indexation problems?</li><li>Do the sitemaps follow proper XML <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php" target="_blank">protocols</a>?</li></ul>

- [ ] Canonical version of the site established through 301s 
      

- [ ] Canonical version of site is specified in Google Webmaster Tools 
      

- [ ] Rel canonical link tag is properly implemented across the site
      <p>Make sure it points to the correct page, and <a href="https://moz.com/blog/catastrophic-canonicalization" target="_blank">every page doesn't point to the homepage</a>.</p>

- [ ] Uses absolute URLs instead of relative URLs 
      <p>This can cause a lot of problems if you have a root domain with secure sections.</p>



## Site Speed

<p>Additional reading:</p><ul><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank">Google Page Speed Insights</a></li><li><a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/page-speed/" target="_blank">Best Practices for Page Speed</a></li><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a></li></ul>
  
- [ ] Review page load time for key pages
      <p><a href="https://moz.com/blog/site-speed-are-you-fast-does-it-matter" target="_blank">Is it significant</a> for users or search engines?</p>

- [ ] Make sure compression is enabled 
      

- [ ] Enable caching
      

- [ ] Optimize your images for the web

- [ ] Minify your CSS/JS/HTML
      

- [ ] Use a good, fast host and CDN
      



## International


  
- [ ] Review international versions indicated in the URL
      <p>ex: site.com/uk/ or uk.site.com</p>

- [ ] Enable country based targeting in webmaster tools
      <ul><li>If the site is targeted to one specific country, is this specified in webmaster tools?</li><li>If the site has international sections, are they targeted in webmaster tools?</li></ul>

- [ ] Implement hreflang / rel alternate if relevant 
      <p><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en" target="_blank">Documentation</a>.</p>

- [ ] Different country, same language
      <p>If there are multiple versions of a site in the same language (such as /us/ and /uk/, both in English), update the copy so that they are both unique.</p>

- [ ] Make sure the currency reflects the country targeted 
      

- [ ] Ensure the URL structure is in the native language
      <p>Try to avoid having all URLs in the default language.</p>



## Analytics


  
- [ ] Analytics tracking code is on every page
      <ul><li>You can check this using the "custom" filter in a Screaming Frog Crawl or by looking for self referrals.</li><li>Are there pages that should be blocked?</li></ul>

- [ ] Analytics is properly tracking and capturing internal searches 
      

- [ ] Demographics tracking is set up 
      

- [ ] Internal IP addresses are excluded
      

- [ ] Meta refresh and JavaScript redirects are avoided
      <p>These can artificially lower bounce rates.</p>

- [ ] Event tracking is set up for key user interactions
      <p>An example from <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>.</p>
